# ServerDashboard

This is more or less a project for me to become familiar with Angular, TypeScript and Bootstrap. I don't know whether it will ever see a release.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
